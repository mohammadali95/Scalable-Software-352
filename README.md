# Functional Programming CSCI 365

* This is course taught by Brent Yorgey at Hendrix College. I will be uploading the assignments assigned and their solutions through the semester Spring'18 semester. 

## Course Description
* This course explores functional programming in depth, with a unifying focus on recursion. It combines practical programming experience in Haskell with a deep exploration of the underlying theory. Covered topics include algebraic data types and pattern matching, static type systems, recursion and induction, folds, lambda calculus, laziness, functors, and monads.
