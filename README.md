# SCALABLE SOFTWARE
This course introduces the skills needed for writing large programs (on the order of 1000+ lines) using the Java programming language. To this end, we explore in depth object-oriented development, testing, and version control techniques. We pay special attention to writing precise requirements and creating user-centric interfaces. The four course projects incorporate relevant technologies for modern software design, including network programming, databases, and multithreading. In each assignment, we integrate multiple concepts in the context of developing realistic software applications. 
## Project 1
Project 1 is a Music Sampler Application. You can add a music sample, play it,
and make a playlist. You can also buffer forward through a song and play it from
a time you wish the song to played from.

## Project 2
Project 2 is a peer to peer networking application where you can connect to
another peer and share messages and images. Worked with Ryan Murrey and Josh-
Robbins.

## Project 3
Project 3 is a Password Manager. The best App to store, edit and keep track of
your passwords! Worked with Anna Holmes and Samantha Wycoff.

## Project 4
Project 4 is a BloodDonor application. It keeps track of people who want to
donate blood and what type of blood they have. It also keeps track of patients
and what blood type they have. This is an Application for a small scaled hospital
which needs to keep track of its donor's and patient's blood types. Worked with
Ryan Murrey and Samantha Wycoff.
